Ext-JS-4.X-CRUD-Demo

Simple MVC CRUD demo for ExtJS 4.X.

After assistance from skirtle (http://www.sencha.com/forum/member.php?197255-skirtle), was able to adjust the code to work in both 4.0.7 and 4.1b2.

This app is a demonstration of ExtJS MVC.  It uses a VERY simple php backend.  The backend uses sessions to manage adds, changes.  Again, this app is intended to demonstrate and learn ExtJS.  I am not trying to show how to create a PHP backend.

The primary working portion of this app is the "Customer Management" section.  You can add and edit customers.

The "Vendor Management" section does NOT work.  You will see a list of vendors.  However, you cannot add or edit vendors.  The "Vendor Management" section is just there to demonstrate the use of a tab panel.


Instructions:
1. Clone this repository to wherever you like.
    Example : /app
2. In your Apache webroot, create a symbolic link to /app/Ext-JS-4.X-CRUD-Demo
3. In /app/Ext-JS-4.X-CRUD-Demo  create a symbolic link to the 4.1b2 version of ExtJS
    Example : ln -s /app/ext-4.1.0-beta-2/ ext
4.  See "directory_structure.png" for example of directory setup.
5.  You should now be able to access the demo from your localhost in a browser.
